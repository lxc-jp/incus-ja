# Support

<!-- Include start release -->

Incus maintains different release branches in parallel:

- Long term support (LTS) releases: upcoming
- Feature releases: Incus 0.x

<!-- Include end release -->

The upcoming LTS release will be Incus 6.0, which will supported until June 2029 and will get frequent bugfix and security updates, but won't receive any feature additions.

Feature releases will be pushed out about every quarter and contain new features as well as bugfixes.
The normal support length for those releases is until the next release comes out.
Some Linux distributions might offer longer support for particular feature releases that they decided to ship.
